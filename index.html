        <h4>Background</h4>

        <p>Increasingly over time, people have come to view art as an attractive investment vehicle. Despite this ever-expanding interest, however, the current art market remains a closed market with high entry barriers, lacking in transparency and market dynamics. The high costs of purchasing and maintaining artworks pose steep financial challenges for active as well as potential participants in the market, and limited sources of market information, e.g., with respect to  art’s value estimation process and channels of distribution, render the information’s objectivity questionable. While artworks can yield long-term profits, much of high-end art cannot be liquidated quickly and are not suited to generating short-term profits because of the art market’s characteristics. Every other market has evolved along with new technologies and changes around the world, but only the art market has remained stagnant since its start.</p>

      <h4>Concept</h4>

      <p>Companies that are listed on stock exchanges are not owned by any single individual; they may have a majority shareholder, but anyone can obtain at least 1 share of the company and profit from trading it. Supply and demand of company’s share determine its price, which directly reflects the company’s valuation. Information regarding listed companies are publicly available and are thoroughly audited to provide a fair and safe market.
      To solve the problems of current art market, we applied the concept of stock market to an artwork as if it is a publicly traded company. Artstock Exchange redefines the concept of artwork ownership by providing a new platform to trade and own artworks’ shares.

        <h4>Blockchain Technology</h4>

        <p>For Artstock Exchange, it is crucial to achieve security and transparency in transactions, while proving capable of processing large volume of trade orders instantly. Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that enables the sharing of transaction information with everyone who is involved. In addition to blockchain’s superior advantages of having unprecedented data security and the ease of transparent balance checking and asset transfers, the Ethereum protocol utilizes smart contracts to automatically execute complex financial transactions. However, the blockchain technology alone is not enough to build a serviceable exchange because it lacks stable currency, has limited processing volume and long processing time, and the network fees that users must unfairly pay for any type of action on the system become burdensome over time.</p>

        <h4>Our patented hybrid solution</h4>

        <p>Artstock Exchange’s patented hybrid system innovatively solve these shortcomings of blockchain technology.While still utilizing the security and transparency of blockchain, we’ve implemented the centralized server system’s superior method of fast processing of large transaction volume, and created a stable currency called Digital USD to establish an infrastructure for a secured trading platform. Our hybrid system records all transactions and asset balance records on Ethereum blockchain, while processing the matchmaking of orders on the centralized server to maximize the efficiency. Although matchmaking of orders technically occurs outside of blockchain, all matching processes are encrypted with users’ signatures and recorded on Ethereum; this proves that all orders are made by the users themselves and that no transactional data has been tampered with. Furthermore, by resolving actions in the centralized server, users no longer need to pay gas fees. This core concept is the leading advanced system that will enable Artstock Exchange to be the first commercialized blockchain service in the world.</p>
