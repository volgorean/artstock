    <h2 class="s-title">The current problematic art market must change to address market needs</h2>
    <p>For more than ever, people are considering artwork as an attractive investment vehicle. Despite these interests, however, the current art market remains as a closed market with high entry barriers that lacks transparency and market dynamics. High costs of purchasing and maintaining artworks make it financially challenging for anyone to participate in the market, and the limited source of market information, such as artwork’s value estimation process and channels of distribution, makes information’s objectivity questionable. While artworks can yield long-term profits, they cannot be liquidated quickly nor generate short-term profits because of art market’s characteristics. Every other market has evolved along with new technologies and changes around the world, but only the art market has remained stagnant since its start.</p>

    <h2 class="s-title">Stock exchange for artwork’s shares</h2>

    <p>Companies that are listed on stock exchanges are not owned by any single individual; they may have a majority shareholder, but anyone can obtain at least 1 share of the company and profit from trading it. Supply and demand of company’s share determine its price, which directly reflects the company’s valuation. Information regarding listed companies are publicly available and are thoroughly audited to provide a fair and safe market.
    To solve the problems of current art market, we applied the concept of stock market to an artwork as if it is a publicly traded company. Artstock Exchange redefines the concept of artwork ownership by providing a new platform to trade and own artworks’ shares.
