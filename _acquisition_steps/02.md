Immediately following the approval of acquisition proposal, the escrowed money is distributed to all shareholders (even those who disapproved the sale) in accordance to their ownership proportion. The acquirer can decide where to get the purchased artwork delivered, and the artwork is delisted from the system. The entire acquisition process and result is recorded on the blockchain, which will prove to be useful in verifying the provenance and authenticity of the artwork.
