Artstock Exchange provides new business opportunities for the auction houses, galleries, and private dealers. It is not easy for an average collector to directly list his/her artwork on the platform, because the process requires expert knowledge such as the artwork’s valuation, authenticity determination, insurance, and marketing. Just like the agencies that assist the IPO process in the stock market, current art market businesses will be able to utilize their expert knowledge and services to assess the market demands and determine the appropriate listing price, and do their utmost to make artwork listings successful. In return, they would be compensated based on the result of the listing. From the investors’ perspective, they would also appreciate involving expert experience because such participation provides credibility of traded artworks. It is also possible to form a portfolio of different artworks and list the portfolio on the system, as a “gallery share.” Credible market businesses can form portfolios and list them to finance their growth. Gallery shares are also a safer investment option for investors who lack knowledge and experience in dealing with artworks.
