Gallery X has a good relationship with Tom, as he has bought artworks through Gallery X many times.

Tom may come to Gallery X (or Gallery X may approach to convince Tom) to list his artwork via APO. 

Gallery X could take care of listing requirements (wall space for display, insurance, authenticity validation, marketing, etc.) in exchange for a percentage of the amount raised.

Gallery X can also make use of listed artwork to attract visitors to Gallery X
