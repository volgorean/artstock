Jeff is an artist, tired of being taken advantage of the sale of his works by the dealers.

He sold his last work for $1 million to a gallery 3 years ago, which is now worth $5 million. Jeff was not able to benefit from this work’s rise in value.

On Artstock Exchange, Jeff is able to list his new work for $1 million valuation, while retaining 20% of the ownership.

Jeff is able to immediately receive payments for 80% ownership that he liquidated, and wait for the valuation to increase. 3 years later, when the valuation becomes $5 million, Jeff can also benefit from the rise in his work’s popularity.
