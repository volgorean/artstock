Tom is a collector who has multiple artworks in his collection. He needs financing options to purchase a new artwork.

Without needing to sell one of the artworks that he owns, Tom can list it on the Artstock Exchange to retain 30% (or however much of his choosing) of ownership and raise money for 70% of its valuation.

He can now use money gained from APO process to add another artwork to his collection.

Tom finds an artwork in trading on the Artstock Exchange, currently valued at $10 million, and wants to have it on his living room wall.

He can propose in the system to acquire that artwork, by offering to pay $11 million. Artworkâ€™s shareholders will vote yes or no, but with enough approvals, Tom can acquire the artwork for $11 million.
