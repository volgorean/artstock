Artists can directly present and sell their artworks on Artstock Exchange without involving middleman institutions; renowned artists or artists with significant support would have a greater chance of a successful APO. Artists can also list their project plans on the system to finance their future projects. New artists with potential can be discovered and gain a spotlight through their artworks via Artstock Exchange. Realistically, high-end artworks are unlikely to have large price volatility in a short amount of time; investors are likely to find artworks by new artists (with potential) to be more attractive and strive to discover them, because their prices can skyrocket for many reasons. Artists no longer need to wait to be selected or discovered by the influential galleries or individuals, because they can be recognized and evaluated by the market. In the traditional market, artists are not able to benefit from their past works being resold at higher values. Artstock Exchange, however, allows artists to benefit from secondary trading because they can retain a certain percentage of ownership upon listing.
