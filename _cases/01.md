name: Seller & Buyer

Normally, a collector would want to list his artworks at the highest possible value to maximize the returns, but considering his/her personal needs or market’s situation, s/he may end up listing at a discount. In any case, s/he hypothetically may decide to sell and liquidate 70%, and act in various ways with the remaining 30% depending on market performance. Lister can freely decide on % sell/retain ratio, but since a majority owner plays a significant role in swaying the outcome of an acquisition vote, the market will discover an appropriate ratio. The market will decide whether the conditions are acceptable or not, and therefore the agreed share price can be considered fair regardless of its profitability. Purchasing a whole artwork is also possible on Artstock Exchange by placing an acquisition offer, valued at its market cap + α. The sale of an artwork is determined by shareholders’ voting result, and if the acquisition is approved, the artwork is delisted and delivered to the buyer, and shareholders automatically receive the proceeds from the sale. Artstock Exchange is a trading platform not only for the shares, but for the artworks themselves, as well.
