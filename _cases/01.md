John is a fan of Picasso, but only has $50 to spend. 

He wouldn’t be able to buy any Picasso’s artwork in the traditional market, but at Artstock Exchange he can buy a share of Picasso’s work, which is currently valued at $50/share.

He can now visit a gallery where it is being displayed at, and gain free admission by presenting a proof of ownership of his share.

3 days later, due to high demand for the artwork, the value increased to $60/share.

John can sell his sthare to make $10 profit.
