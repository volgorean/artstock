question: In working with galleries and artists, please explain the relationship concerning commission structures. Dealers take 50% of retail price but do (usually extend a 10% to curators/consultants).

Dealers/consultants in the version 2.0 can offload the market setting task onto the platform. Their role will switch to building interest in the artwork/artist to ensure a successful APO of the artwork. This is also where gallery brand names and expertise can benefit the listers directly. The lister can benefit as a % of the final APO valuation. The ASX platform provides a global market through which we can offer. 
Galleries can customize whatever fees they think are okay under the market. We do not precribe a limit at the moment. We believe that the market will come to equilibrium on this issue. If a world famous gallery wants to charge 50% commission on the APO valuation, they can do so. However, competition can undercut them to 40%, whereby the market will decide the fair price of listing and promotion services.
