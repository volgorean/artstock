question: Please describe more fully on showing work in physical locations/galleries. Most shows are highly curatorated, so how will showing random works fit with the galleries vision for exhibitions?

This is not a random collection of artworks; Galleries or curators can propose shows and we can open up new ways to organize, based on the inventory we have. 
1.0 artstock gallery will be managed by us and curated based on the artworks that are pledged to us for APO. 
In future releases, inventroy will be distributed among various galleries and a custom show can be curated from among all the works on the platform. 
In future releases if inventory is widely distributed, and already being displayed, we can map their locations and curate “art walks” to visit different pieces where they currently sit.
