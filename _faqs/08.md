question: With each work being offered for sale, going through the voting/approval process to the investors/members – what will be considered a quorum and how will the voting process be executed?

Art holders/owners are king. As soon as the holder -wants- to sell, they’ve already lost. So even if they want to sell the pieces, they won’t initiate the sale. 
The mechanism we are encouraging is for a listing agent to seek out additional sales opportunities by convicning holders to offer their artworks. Any artworks can be listen for the listing fee, but APO hopefuls can decide whether it will be a prudent business move. Listers/Sellers  can structure their APO sale as they wish (how much of the total ownership is being released, the pricing, the voting procedure (quorum limit), voting period), and then decide what the best structure is. The market will probably evolve best practices. 
Provenance also can become a marketable attribute; if the original holder was brad pitt or damien hirst, this can also be marketed to influence the APO price.
