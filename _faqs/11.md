question: Can investors/members “sell” or divest their investments at any time or only when the particular work they invested in is sold?

Any time. 24/7. It is an open market. APO final result must first occur before ownership transfers. During the APO you are pledging an offer; once the results are resolved at the end of the APO, the shares will pass and the secondary market will begin.
