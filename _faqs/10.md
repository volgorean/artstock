question: What is the benefit/ROI for galleries or auction houses to use ASx?
---
Galleries/Auction houses simply act as listers on the platform. Their goal is to build interest in the APO. 
Right now, competition is between themselves fighting for a piece of the pie. However, our goal is to enlarge the pie; big fish/small point; small fish/big pond. The tech market will be disrupted sooner or later. Adapt or die may apply. But sooner or later either us or someone like us will force the industry to evolve. We want everyone to succeed.
