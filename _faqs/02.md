question: Who/what is the demographic target market?

1.0/2.0/3.0

1 - Our customers consist of art holders, as well as the participants in the art market. In the initial phase, we are partnering with holders of famous artworks to be able to offer their pieces on the platform.

2- Art speculators are the primary drivers of the platform, but there will be independent collectors who just like holding the art as a hobby (wording?) 
 
Damien Hirst story; speculator can get in early. 
 
Famous dealers/galleries; their greatest value is the trust theyâ€™ve built up in their brand name; can leverage this to offer art consultancy. In 2.0 version, galleries can find artists to raise new artists to maturity. 
 
The ultimate goal for the Artstock Exchange is to provide a platform for individual artists to distribute their own artworks
