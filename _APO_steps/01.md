Artstock Exchange has an art committee that consists experts from many different areas, and the committee will assess the appropriateness of the listing-requested artworks based on their profile data, such as authenticity, maintenance condition, and insurance status. The art committee will provide credibility to artworks listed on Artstock Exchange, therefore protecting the investment. Artstock Exchange will host a diverse pool of artworks from different eras, genres, and price ranges, so that the investors have many options to choose from. We also encourage collaborating with renowned galleries to have them select and list good artworks, because their market analysis and resources would allow them to provide artworks that the market wants. Eventually, anyone will be able to list artworks from any level, and let the market determine the validity of their valuation.
