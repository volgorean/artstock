The standard protocol of Artstock Exchange is to have listed artworks be displayed at the Artstock Gallery (operated by the Artstock Exchange) or at a public location, to allow any shareholder to visit and enjoy the artwork at any time. Public display of artworks aligns with our vision of sharing the value of art by bringing artworks out from collectorsâ€™ bedroom or living room walls; this enables the sharing of intrinsic, artistic value of art in addition to sharing the commercial value through trading. Eventually, the market will decide on the best practices for displaying artworks, whether they are shown at famous galleries, storage vaults, hotels, or restaurants, by reflecting their preference on the price valuation.
