We will establish an art committee consisting of wide-ranging experts to validate the artworks and their reviews, and list renowned artworks that can catch publicâ€™s attention. The service should be easy and convenient enough for individuals who are not familiar with blockchain and cryptocurrency to use. We will operate Artstock Gallery to display and the listed artworks, and form partnerships with renowned galleries, museums, and collectors to announce how Artstock Exchange can be a landscape of new business opportunities for current art market players. By outsourcing services such as authentication, insurance, and transportation, we will minimize the operations involvement, and focus on stabilizing the service based on user feedback.
