We will expand the platform by integrating various service providers. Participation of agencies for artwork listing will be encouraged, and 3rd-party entities can provide services such as authentication, insurance, and transportation within our platform. Portfolio listing (gallery share) can offer safer alternative for investing, while expanding listing targets to include artworks by the new artists will widen investment options. We will plan a world tour of artwork exhibitions, providing opportunities for the greater public to enjoy the art, and therefore contribute to increasing the artworksâ€™ valuation.
